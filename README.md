:warning: This package is deprecated and unmaintained. Please **DO NOT** use it in production unless itâ€™s absolutely necessary and at your own risk. There are several other modern Shamsi/Jalali date packages out there like [this one](http://farhadi.ir/blog/1389/02/10/persian-calendar-for-php-53/) which you can use.

:round_pushpin: If you happen to be a php developer and want to maintain this project, please give me a shout so I can give you write access to this project.

# jDateTime

PHP class to convert dates from Gregorian calendar system to Jalali calendar system and vice versa. Supports dates beyond 2038.  
Jalali, also known as Shamsi or Hijri Shamsi is the Iranian calendar system. 
It is also support Falaki month names.

# About v2.2.0

PHP's default `date` function does not support years higher than 2038, so the `DateTime` class was introduced in PHP5 to solve this problem and provide more sophisticated date methods. Iranian users have been using an old `jdate` function to convert Gregorian date to the Jalali equivalent, which is completely based on the old php `date` function so its pretty much out-dated.
